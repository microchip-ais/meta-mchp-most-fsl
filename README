I. Adding the mchp-most layer to your build
=================================================

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of it.

Assuming the mchp-most layer exists in your directory for BSP sources (usually
<bsp-root-directory>/sources), you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the mchp-most layer to bblayers.conf (usually locating in
<bsp-root-directory>/build/conf/), along with any other layers needed.  e.g.:

  BBLAYERS = " \
    ...
    ${BSPDIR}/sources/meta-mchp-most \
    "


II. Misc
========

The project https://github.com/microchip-ais/mchp-fsl-bsp-base.git helps to
build FSL Community BSP with the Microchip MOST Linux Driver from the scratch.
